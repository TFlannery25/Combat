3D First Person Shooter

Combat is a first person shooter game that I developed in 2022. The game features a small 3D city space in which the player will fight off the enemies by shooting them for as long as they can until they die.  

# The Player
> The player conrols their character from the first person point of view using w,a,s,d to move forward, left, right, and backwards as well as the space bar to jump. The player is equiped with a gun that will fire a hitscan bullet upon left clicking. The player starts with 200 health which is displayed by the blue health bar in the bottom left of the screen.

# The Enemies
> The enemies are green cylindric capsule shaped figures equiped with two guns that fire projectile bullets. The enemy AI is designed to track the player to move towards find a sightline of the player. Once in range tehy will enter and attack state in which they will fire their guns in the direction of the player. Enemies will spawn in three different spawn points after set amount of times between each spawn.

# Game Stats
> For each round the game will track the amount of kills the player gets as well as the amount of time the player survives the round. At the end of the game these stats will be displayed on screen.
