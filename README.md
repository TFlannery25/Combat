# Combat
3D First Person Shooter

Combat is a first-person shooter game that I developed in 2022. The game features a small 3D city space in which the player fights off enemies by shooting them, with the objective of surviving as long as possible.

# The Player
> The player controls their character from a first-person point of view using W, A, S, D to move forward, left, right, and backward, as well as the spacebar to jump. The player is equipped with a gun that fires a hitscan bullet when left-clicking. The player starts with 200 health, which is displayed by the blue health bar in the bottom left of the screen.

# The Enemies
> The enemies are green, cylindrical, capsule-shaped figures equipped with two guns that fire projectile bullets. The enemy AI is designed to track the player, moving toward and finding a sightline of the player. Once in range, they will enter an attack state in which they will fire their guns in the direction of the player. Enemies will spawn at three different spawn points after a set amount of time between each spawn.

# Game Stats
> For each round, the game will track the number of kills the player gets, as well as the amount of time the player survives the round. At the end of the game, these stats will be displayed on screen.
